# Summary

I didn't have a pipe to build this https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2948231 so I decided to modify the model to have a pipe built into it. It's made of 2 pieces that join together by internal mounting (believe me, it works fine). 

Part list:
- 2x M3 screws and nuts
- 4x M3 washers (optional)
- I suggest including a carabiner to secure the controllers 

Check out this remix https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3232788, it looks way better!

## Print Settings

Infill: 25+ % using zigzag to make it strong

Notes: 
Right one can be printed without support. 
Left one needs support. I recommend using concentric support at 30%, with the controller end facing upwards, support placement set to touching buildplate, and block support for the upper half of the model.
